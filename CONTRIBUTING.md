# Contributing

## Workflow
1. Branch from `main`.
2. Use **Conventional Commits** (e.g., `feat: add X`, `fix: resolve Y`).
3. Keep PRs small; ensure CI passes.

## Conventional Commits
Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert.  
Format: `type(scope): short description`

## Reviews
At least 1 approval before merging to `main`.

## Security
Do not commit secrets. Report via `SECURITY.md`.
